# Sustainable Celebration: Cinnamon Rainforest Restoration Project

To commemorate World Environment Day, i.e. 5 June 2023, the Chairman of John Keells Holdings Kishan Balendra visited the RukRakaganno reforestation site in Suduwalipotha. Subsequently, this project won the Chairman's Award for Sustainability, as sent to us by the Head of the John Keells Foundation, Carmaline Jayasuriya:

"Happy to share the good news that the Cinnamon Rainforest Restoration Project was the recipient of a Chairperson's Award for Sustainability on Friday. Would like to applaud and acknowledge the efforts of you and your team and all involved."

To commemorate the visit to the reforestation site, John Keells Holdings Chairman, Kishan Balendra, plants an endemic plant (Artocarpus nobilis) in the presence of Dushy Perera, President of RukRakaganno. Artocarpus nobilis, the Ceylon Breadfruit, is a tree species of the Moraceae family, endemic to the south-western regions of Sri Lanka. It is known as "Wal dhel - වල් දෙල්" , "Baedi dhel - බැදÒ දෙල්" or as "Hingala dhel - Ôිංගල දෙල්" by local people.
