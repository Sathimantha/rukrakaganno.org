# Tree Planting after the Tsunami

The Tsunami which hit in 2004 devastated the coastal areas and the vegetation protecting the land. It was found that in areas where there was coastal vegetation, the tsunami caused less damage, than where there was not. Ruk Rakaganno collaborated with schools to replant trees and shrubs such as Pandanus, Spinifex, and Barringtonia in the South and South East coastal areas.

The students were involved in the hands-on project of replanting the trees, during which they learned about the importance of the vegetation for protective purposes.
