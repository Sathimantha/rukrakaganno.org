                        <p>&emsp; Ruk Rakaganno is a largely <b>volunteer based, non-governmental</b> organization that
                            is funded by grants, donations, membership fees and other revenueâˆ’generating activities
                            carried out by the organization itself.</p>
                        <p>&emsp; It was founded in 1975 by a group of environmentally-conscious individuals who were
                            concerned about the rapid deforestation taking place in the country and wished to take
                            measures against it.</p>
                        <p>&emsp; During this initial period, Ruk Rakaganno was largely an advocacy group, which sought
                            to influence policy makers and private deforesters. Presently, alongside advocacy, the group
                            partakes in hands-on projects.</p>

                        <p>&emsp;Ruk Rakaganno is member-based with an elected committee, headed by a president. The
                            committee has primary responsibility for decision making of policies and projects. </p>
                        <p>&emsp;Ruk Rakaganno welcomes and encourages those who wish to become members, who would work
                            with the society in their projects and advocacy to protect and conserve the environment.</p>
